# PAAssessment
This is a Product Advisory Repository Assessment

## Cloud Functions (scenario grading)

`functions/` holds `gradeApplicationScenario`, which grades the free-text
"VP buy-in" scenario question via Groq's free tier. One-time setup on a
machine with Node 20+ and the Firebase CLI:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools   # if not already installed
firebase login
cd functions && npm install
firebase functions:secrets:set GROQ_API_KEY   # paste your Groq key when prompted
```

The Firebase project (`product-advisory-lms`) must be on the **Blaze**
(pay-as-you-go) plan for Cloud Functions to deploy at all — do this once
in the Firebase console (Project Settings → Usage and billing). The
function itself runs on Groq's $0 tier; Blaze's own free quota should
cover this volume comfortably, but it does require a payment method on
the account.

Deploy or redeploy after any change to `functions/`:

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions:gradeApplicationScenario
```

To change the Groq model (e.g. if the current one is deprecated on the
free tier), edit `GROQ_MODEL` in `functions/.env` and redeploy — no code
change needed. Check console.groq.com/docs/models first.

Graded answers (including the internal rationale never shown to
respondents) land in the `scenarioGradingLog` Firestore collection for
manual review — it holds no uid and isn't read by the app.
